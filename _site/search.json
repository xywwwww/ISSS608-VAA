    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol <- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop <- read_xls(\"Hands-on_Ex03/data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %>%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nWarning: `mutate_each_()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0.\nℹ Please use `across()` instead.\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_()/exit_() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\nThe animated bubble chart\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\ngg <- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nWarning in geom_point(aes(size = Population, frame = Year), alpha = 0.7, :\nIgnoring unknown aesthetics: frame\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\nWarning in p$x$data[firstFrame] <- p$x$frames[[1]]$data: number of items to\nreplace is not a multiple of replacement length\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAppropriate ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot. The output is then saved as an R object called gg.\nggplotly() is then used to convert the R graphic object into an animated svg object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using plot_ly() method.\n\nbp <- globalPop %>%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent, \n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          )\nbp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nVisit this link for a very interesting implementation of gganimate by your senior.\nBuilding an animation step-by-step with gganimate.\nCreating a composite gif with multiple gganimate panels\n\nAll credits of this hands on exercise goes to Dr. Kam Tin Seong"

It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements. If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis link provides online version of the reference guide and several useful articles.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\nThe tbl_graph object\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr verbs in tidygraph\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\nUsing tbl_graph() to build tidygraph data model.\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\nReviewing the output tidygraph’s graph object\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# A tibble: 54 × 4\n     id label               Department     Title                                \n  <dbl> <chr>               <chr>          <chr>                                \n1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                     \n2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                     \n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                     \n4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                     \n5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Manag…\n6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager        \n# ℹ 48 more rows\n#\n# A tibble: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  <int> <int> <ord>    <int>\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\nReviewing the output tidygraph’s graph object\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\nChanging the active object\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %>%\n  activate(edges) %>%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function."

Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).\nThe ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the coloring of the plot\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with ggraph’s layouts\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n \n\n\nFruchterman and Reingold layout\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\nModifying network nodes\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\n\nModifying edges\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line."

But still if we zoom in, we can get some information from it.We can see that there are some major fluctuation in shelter amount and rent adjustment in march and April. Education amount is incurred on first day of the month and that if we zoom in. We can see that recreation and food demonstrates a regular pattern as shown in the pic below\n\nLets try to map above information in terms of months\n\n\n3.2.4 Average Amount Spent by Category per Month\n\n\nShow the code\n# Extract month from timestamp\nfinancial_data_agg <- finance %>%\n  filter(category != \"Wage\") %>%\n  mutate(month = format(timestamp, \"%Y-%m\")) %>%\n  group_by(participantId, category, month) %>%\n  summarize(total = sum(amount), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Calculate average amount spent by category per month\ncategory_month_avg <- financial_data_agg %>%\n  group_by(category, month) %>%\n  summarize(avg_amount = mean(total))\n\n# Create bar chart\ncategory_month_plot <- ggplot(category_month_avg, aes(x = month, y = avg_amount, fill = category)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Month\", y = \"Average Amount Spent\", title = \"Average Amount Spent by Category per Month\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,\n                                   vjust = 0.5,\n                                   hjust = 0.5))\n# Plot interactive chart\nggplotly(category_month_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the chart above we observe that the amount spent on average per category is indeed in the following order with education < food < recreation < shelter. We can also observe some anomalies in March and April. There is an exceeding large expenditure on shelter and recreation in march and in April the rent adjustment increased exceptionally as well. The expenditure in shelter may have being transferred to increase rent adjustment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsing theme minimal will result in overlapping of x-axis.

This may be because a higher wage may mean more responsibility at work and hence greater amount of stress which lead to lower joviality\nLet’s perform a statistical test to determine if there is a correlation between joviality and wage\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creates a plot of joviality against wage\nggscatterstats(\n  data = wage_data,\n  x = total_spent,\n  y = joviality,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  ) + labs(x = \"Wage\", y = \"Joviality\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 5% significance level, since the p value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between joviality and wage\n\n\n3.3.2 Wage against education level\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creates a plot wage against education level using \"wage_data\" defined above\nggplot(wage_data, aes(x = educationLevel, y = total_spent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, outlier.size = 1) +\n  labs(x = \"Education Level\", y = \"Wage\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the chart above we can observe increasing education level of residents has increasing level of wage\n\n\n3.3.3 Wage against interest group\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creates a plot of wage across interest group using the \"wage_data\" defined above\nggplot(wage_data, aes(x = interestGroup, y = total_spent)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, outlier.size = 1) +\n  labs(x = \"Interest Group\", y = \"Wage\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above chart, wage distribution across interest group seems to be well spread. But Interest group I seems to have attracted on one of the largest wage resident in the city.\nLet’s perform a statistical test to determine if there is a correlation between joviality and wage\n\n# Construct a linear regression model to the wage_data using lm() function.The dependent variable is total_spent, and the independent variables are interestGroup and educationLevel.\nmodel <- lm(total_spent ~ interestGroup + educationLevel, data = wage_data)\nmodel\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total_spent ~ interestGroup + educationLevel, data = wage_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                      (Intercept)                     interestGroupB  \n                         35276.37                           -2849.09  \n                   interestGroupC                     interestGroupD  \n                         -2936.16                             583.35  \n                   interestGroupE                     interestGroupF  \n                         -3019.36                           -5420.24  \n                   interestGroupG                     interestGroupH  \n                         -4753.63                            -993.26  \n                   interestGroupI                     interestGroupJ  \n                            58.03                           -2917.00  \neducationLevelHighSchoolOrCollege            educationLevelBachelors  \n                          5816.44                           28023.60  \n           educationLevelGraduate  \n                         42627.88  \n\n\n\n# Uisng check_collinearity from the performance package to check regression model for multicollinearity by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF)\ncheck_collinearity(model)\n\n# Check for Multicollinearity\n\nLow Correlation\n\n           Term  VIF   VIF 95% CI Increased SE Tolerance Tolerance 95% CI\n  interestGroup 1.04 [1.01, 1.22]         1.02      0.96     [0.82, 0.99]\n educationLevel 1.04 [1.01, 1.22]         1.02      0.96     [0.82, 0.99]\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncheck_c <- check_collinearity(model)\n# Plots the chart of VIF against education level and interest group\nplot(check_c)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the results, we can determine that there is a low correlation between education level and interest group attended against wage\n\n\n3.3.4 Percentage of spending within each category for each group\n\n\nShow the code\n# Calculates the total spending by spending category and household type, excluding the \"Wage\", and calculates the percentage of total spending for each group.

High school educated and bachelors educated has the highest positive rent adjustment which may indicate that there are more landlords from these 2 education backgrounds\n\n\n3.3.6 Recreation spending vs joviality\n\n\nShow the code\n# Keeping only entry with recreation as category in merged_data and save the new data frame as recreation_data\nrecreation_data <- merged_data %>%\n  filter(category == \"Recreation\")\n\n# Create scatter plot of joviality vs recreation spending\nggplot(recreation_data, aes(x = total_spent, y = joviality)) +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(x = \"Recreation Spending\", y = \"Joviality\") + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above observation, it seems that increasing spending would increase joviality until a saturation is reached at around $10000. Note that the chart is plotted on a negative x-axis as spending is accounted for as negative value.\nLet’s perform a statistical test to determine if there is a correlation bewteen joviality and recreation spending\n\n\nShow the code\n# Creates a plot of joviality against recreation spending\nggscatterstats(\n  data = recreation_data,\n  x = total_spent,\n  y = joviality,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  ) + labs(x = \"Recreation\", y = \"Joviality\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 5% significance level, since the p value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between joviality and recreation expenses"

This will serve as the basis for our analysis in detecting companies who might have engaged in illegal fishing."
